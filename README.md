# Tiempo
This repo is an excerpt of my work from the original project as the project itself has a lot of proprietary technology from Vancouver Film School

**ORIGINAL DATE OF COMPLETION**: October 13, 2022

**Development Time**: 4 Months

## **HIGH CONCEPT**

Tiempo is a 3D, single player, third-person platformer where you must make your way up a clock tower to stop your rival inventor from pausing time infinitely across the world. While platforming up the tower, you will encounter enemies and roadblocks in which you will have to use your time pausing and reversing mechanics in order to proceed.
